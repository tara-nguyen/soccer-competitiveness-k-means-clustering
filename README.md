## Abstract

**Background**: The La Liga, the Premier League (EPL), and the Bundesliga have been the [top three soccer leagues in the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_coefficient#Top_leagues_by_period) since 2014. In comparison, the Major League Soccer (MLS) is less known to the world.

**Data and research question**: In this project I analyzed team performances (points per game, win proportions, etc.) in the four soccer leagues from the 2015/2016 season to the 2019/2020 season. The main research question was: **_Which soccer league is the most competitive?_**

**Method and findings**: The entire project was done in R. Through exploratory data analysis and k-means clustering, I found that, in general, the MLS was the most competitive.
